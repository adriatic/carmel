In addition to the obvious alternative to run this app with Visual Studio 2017, it is also possible (and simpler) run it in the cmd.exe (or better, like cmder.exe) by issuing the command **`dotnet run`** in the project's root folder. In that case use URL **`http://localhost:5000/api/components`** to access the API endpoint (instead of the "standard" **`http://localhost:8000/api/components`**, used when the service is started with Visual Studio)
